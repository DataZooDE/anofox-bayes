# Changelog

All notable changes to anofox-bayes are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning is semantic, and
the **draws schema** (`docs/DRAWS_CONTRACT.md`) is versioned separately so that draw
tables persisted by a customer stay readable across extension upgrades.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — initial release, HLD phase 0.1

**SQL surface**

- `anofox_bayes_fit(relation, family, config)` — a pure table in-out function
  returning posterior draws. It materialises nothing itself; persistence is the
  caller's `CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT`.
- `anofox_bayes_rhat`, `anofox_bayes_ess_bulk`, `anofox_bayes_ess_tail` — convergence
  diagnostics as aggregates over `(value, chain, draw)`, for `GROUP BY param`.
- Decision macros: `anofox_bayes_credible_interval` / `_lower` / `_upper`,
  `anofox_bayes_prob_greater` / `_less`, `anofox_bayes_service_level_quantile`,
  `anofox_bayes_status_text`, `anofox_bayes_is_actionable`,
  `anofox_bayes_family_text`.
- `anofox_bayes_version()`, `anofox_bayes_draws_schema_version()`.

**Draws contract**

- `__family__` — which catalog family produced the table, as its BRD F-number
  (`3` = `pooled_gaussian`, `7` = `conjugate_anomaly`). The `value` column is `DOUBLE`,
  so the name cannot travel; reusing the existing F-numbering rather than minting a
  second one keeps one identity per family. Append-only, like `FitStatus` and
  `EngineKind`.
- `__n_groups_unready__` — how many of `__n_groups__` failed their own readiness check.
  `__status__` remains the collapsed worst-case verdict; this says how much of the fit
  that verdict is about.
- Both are new `__`-prefixed metadata rows and therefore **not** breaking:
  `__schema_version__` stays at 1. A consumer that assumed the metadata block was
  exactly eight rows long was relying on something the contract already said not to.
- `__data_fingerprint__` was considered and **not** shipped: a hex digest has no
  lossless home in a `DOUBLE`, and a fingerprint that silently collides is worse than
  an absent one. See `docs/DRAWS_CONTRACT.md`.

**Model catalog**

- **F7 `conjugate_anomaly`** — closed-form Normal-Inverse-Gamma and Gamma-Poisson
  posteriors per group, for anomaly questions answered as posterior tail
  probabilities. Serves the freight-audit agent.
- **F3 `pooled_gaussian`** — conjugate Gaussian linear model with optional partial
  pooling by group; the inference layer for difference-in-differences and interrupted
  time series. Serves the intervention-evaluation agent.

**Engines**

- `exact` — closed-form sampling for conjugate families; the default for both.
- `laplace` — MAP plus curvature on an unconstrained scale, available on **both**
  families. Neither needs it, since both are conjugate; it is there because checking
  it against the exact posterior is the strongest correctness gate in the suite, two
  independent derivations of one distribution. On `conjugate_anomaly` the size of the
  disagreement is itself closed form (`1 - sqrt((n-3)/n)` on the spread of `mu`, per
  group), and the measurement matches it to four digits.

**Validation**

- Simulation-based calibration per family and per engine, with fixtures proving the
  harness rejects overconfident and biased posteriors before any real family runs.
- PyMC golden-run parity suite (`validation/`, uv + pytest), run in CI.
- 153 Rust unit tests, 181 sqllogictest assertions, 32 PyMC parity tests.

### Fixed

- **F3's residual-scale posterior was over-confident.** The Normal-Inverse-Gamma
  shape `a0 + n/2` is correct only when the coefficient prior is proper and
  sigma-scaled; under the default flat prior the textbook shape is `a0 + (n - k)/2`
  for `k` freely estimated coefficients. Every F3 credible interval was too narrow by
  `sqrt((n - k)/n)` — ~2 % on typical designs, growing with `k/n`. Found by the PyMC
  parity suite, which is the only harness that could have: SBC must draw its truth
  from a proper prior, and so only ever exercised the case where the old formula was
  right.

### Notes

- Sampling defaults to one chain, so `anofox_bayes_rhat` is `NULL` unless
  `{'chains': n}` is set. R̂ detects a Markov chain that has not mixed, and both 0.1
  engines draw independently — a second chain would buy an R̂ of 1.0 that means
  nothing. **The gate in 0.1 is ESS**, and tail ESS is its binding half.
- Draws schema version **1**.

### Not yet implemented

NUTS engine, families F1/F2/F4–F6, `anofox_bayes_predict` (posterior- and
prior-predictive), `anofox_scenario` catalog integration, async/job-style fit. See
[docs/BRD.md](docs/BRD.md) §7 and [docs/HLD.md](docs/HLD.md) §9 for phasing.
